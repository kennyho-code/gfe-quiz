# Describe Floats and how they work

## Initial Thoughts

When in display block, objects are usually take the full-width and stack on top of each other. Using the float property allows for an adjacent object to "wrap" around the object with the property. A element with the property float creates a new block formatting context.

## Research
- places element left or right of it's container
- allows inline elements to wrap
- element is removed from normal of the page
- can yuse `clear` to remove float
- flex and grid superceded float for bootstrap
