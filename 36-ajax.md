# Explain Ajax in as much as detail as possible

## Initial Thoughts

Ajax stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML. By default javascript is a synchrnous blocking programming language. However the internet requires lots of asynchronous behavior because of requests and responses. Thus there is Ajax. XML is a data format in which data can be transferred through HTTP. XML stands for extensible Markup Language. It's a means to transfer data between the server and the client. Similar to Html, but more stricter (HTML) is more forgiveable as it's a means to display data to the user.

## Research

- decoupling the data transferring layer and the presentation layer... which allows for more dynamic behavior.
- `XMLHttpRequest` used for async communcations -- also know today as t `fetch` api.
