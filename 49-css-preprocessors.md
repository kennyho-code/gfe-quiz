# What are the advantages and disadvantages of using CSS preprocessors?

## Intial thoughts

- CSS processor is build step where it simplifies CSS somehow. Something like SASS, allows for the nesting in CSS and variables; but alot of the new CSS features alredy allow for it. A tool like tailwind enables fast prototyping but could get messy because of the inline semantics. However there are tools like prettier that can help organize these semantics. These tools enable to enable developers write CSS faster or more ergonomic in terms of writing JS and CSS combined. But is CSS getting more ergonomic where these tools won't be needed anymore? Are the tools having enough staying power to warrant an another abstraction?
