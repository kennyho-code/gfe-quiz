# What's the difference between `inline` and `inline-block`?

## Initial Thoughts

`inline` amd `inline-block` are `display` properties. When an element has either of these properties, then they don't take up the entire width of the page. Rather than are "inline" with the surround elements, usually horizontally. The difference is that `inline` doesn
have a height and width property that affects could position the adjacent elements. Where as `inline-block` could.

## Research

- inputs and spans are default `inline`
- "flow" is how the elements are laid out
