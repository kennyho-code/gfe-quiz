# How is responsive design different from adaptive design?

## Initial thoughts

- Responsive design is "responsive" to the the user's device. Most likely it's the viewport. So a desktop experience usually has a maybe a width of something 800px or wider, and mobile experience is usually something that it's below 800px. The placement of cards, rows, columns are different.... CSS has tools like flex or grid that allows for different placements depending on the user's experience. CSS media queries allow for those different types of experiences.

## Research

- Ethan Marcotte coined the word "responsive design"
- used floats...then flex and grid
- adaptive design uses predetermined layouts for the specific device... less flexible but more precise
- responsive is more flexible but could also be more complex
