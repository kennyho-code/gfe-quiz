# What's the difference bertween "resetting" and "normalizing" css?

## Initial Thoughts

- There a presets in CSS..... user agent style sheets..or defaults that come with the browser... sometimes we want to reset things...such as setting the `box-sizing` to `content-box`. Normalizing....might be putting setting elements to some sort of new default css.

- Resetting - strip everything ... `margin`, `padding`, `font-size` ...etc
- Normalizing - perserves default styles rather than unstyling verything .. corrects bugs for browsers
- reset when for customized sites.
